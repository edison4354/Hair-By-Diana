# Hair By Diana

A website where hair salons and stylists can have a dashboard to manage all their customers. The main features we want to include would be visitor appointment scheduling, admin portal for them to see the visitor appointments, and twilio messaging notification for appointment reminders. We hope to be able to build a platform where small businesses can use our service to automate visitor bookings and simplify communication with their customers. But for now here is the website we built for a Hair By Diana.
